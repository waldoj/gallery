# Gallery

Gallery is a small personal project to display a gallery of photos on a website. It is designed to sit lightly on the server, requiring no database. It's primarily written in PHP, with some Bash scripting.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

2. Launch the local development server (available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)):

```bash
composer serve
```

The Composer script uses PHP's built-in web server and serves the project root, so Twig templates, images, and CSS are available without additional configuration.

## Build

For deployment you can run the build script, which installs dependencies, runs the test suite, and refreshes the library metadata:

```bash
composer build
```

## License
